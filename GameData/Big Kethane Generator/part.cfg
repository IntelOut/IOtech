description = This module generates kethane by filtering traces of useful gases and sun elementary particles from it's surroundings, and fuses them together inside of the ARC (Advanced Reaction Chamber) which is located centrally in the module where they miraculously transformed into Kethane by unknown reaction. IO starts to redesign this module at 2015.
